Okay, I will go through the references I provided for your SRAS project report and indicate where each one would typically be cited or is relevant within the text I generated for you.

Keep in mind that for a mini-project, direct citation of every foundational concept might not be as rigorously enforced as in a research paper, but it's good practice.

**General Approach to Citing:**

*   **Introduction/Background:** Cite foundational papers that establish the problem domain and key concepts (like Pang & Lee for sentiment analysis).
*   **Literature Review:** Cite papers that define terms, describe different approaches/techniques, or are seminal works for specific methods (e.g., Manning et al. for TF-IDF, specific papers for ML algorithms if you go into their theoretical details).
*   **Methodology:** Cite the tools/libraries you used (Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas) if you are describing their specific functions or classes that you implemented. If you're describing a standard process (like TF-IDF), you might cite a foundational text (like Manning et al.).
*   **Technology Stack:** This section usually lists tools, formal citation in text might not be needed here if cited elsewhere.
*   **Results/Discussion (Comparative Analysis):** Cite papers when comparing your results or approach to established benchmarks or other methods.

For your mini-project, focusing on citing when you first introduce a key concept from a paper (like sentiment analysis definition) or a specific tool/algorithm implementation (like TF-IDF from a textbook, or Scikit-learn when you say you used its Decision Tree) is a good strategy. You don't need to cite every single sentence, but ensure major ideas or methods borrowed from external sources are acknowledged.
