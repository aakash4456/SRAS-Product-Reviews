**I. Project Overview & Motivation (High-Level)**

1.  **Problem Statement in Your Own Words:**
    *   **What you should explain:** Why is analyzing product reviews important? What are the specific challenges your SRAS project tries to solve (e.g., volume of reviews, inconsistency between text sentiment and star ratings)?
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** "My project, SRAS, tackles the issue that while online reviews are crucial, there are too many to read manually. Also, sometimes what people write (their sentiment) doesn't quite match the star rating they give. SRAS tries to automate finding the sentiment in the text and then checks if that sentiment logically aligns with the star rating."

2.  **Objectives of SRAS:**
    *   **What you should explain:** What did you aim to achieve with this project? List your main goals.
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** "The main goals were:
        1.  To build a system that can automatically tell if a review text is positive or negative using machine learning.
        2.  To create a way to compare this text sentiment with the star rating to see if they are 'Aligned' or 'Not Aligned'.
        3.  To develop a simple web interface where someone can type in a review and rating and see the analysis.
        4.  To use specific tools like Python, NLTK for text processing, Scikit-learn for the Decision Tree model, TF-IDF for features, FastAPI for the backend, and React for the frontend."

3.  **Scope of the Project:**
    *   **What you should explain:** What did your project *do*, and equally importantly, what did it *not* do? This shows you understand the boundaries.
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** "SRAS focuses on binary sentiment (Positive/Negative) for English text and checks alignment with 1-5 star ratings. It uses a Decision Tree model. It does *not* handle neutral sentiment, sarcasm, real-time scraping, or aspect-based sentiment (sentiment about specific features like 'battery life')."

**II. Methodology & Technical Details**

4.  **Dataset & Labeling:**
    *   **What you should explain:** What data did you use (`Training_Data.csv`)? How did you define your target labels (Positive/Negative) for training the sentiment model?
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** "I used a CSV file named `Training_Data.csv` which contains product reviews and their ratings. For training my sentiment model, I created labels from these ratings: if a rating was 3 stars or more, I labeled it as 'Positive' (1), and if it was less than 3 stars (1 or 2), I labeled it as 'Negative' (0)."
    *   **Be ready for:** "Why did you choose 3 stars as the threshold for positive?" (Answer: It's a common simplification for binary classification, though 3-star can be ambiguous, it provides a starting point. For the alignment logic, 3-star reviews are treated differently if text is strongly valenced).

5.  **Text Preprocessing Steps:**
    *   **What you should explain:** Walk through the steps you took to clean the review text before feeding it to the model. Why is each step important?
    *   **Your SRAS Context (from `Training_py.py` and `api.py`):**
        *   "First, I removed special characters and punctuation using regular expressions (`re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', sentence)`) to focus on the words."
        *   "Then, I converted all text to lowercase (`token.lower()`) so that words like 'Good' and 'good' are treated the same."
        *   "Next, I performed tokenization (`nltk.word_tokenize`) to split the text into individual words."
        *   "Finally, I removed common English stop words (`stopwords.words('english')`) like 'the', 'is', 'a', because they usually don't carry much sentiment."

6.  **Feature Extraction (TF-IDF):**
    *   **What you should explain:** How did you convert text into numbers that the machine learning model can understand? Explain TF-IDF simply.
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** "I used TF-IDF, which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
        *   **Term Frequency (TF):** How often a word appears in a single review.
        *   **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** This gives more weight to words that are rare across all reviews and less weight to very common words.
        *   So, TF-IDF gives a score to each word that shows how important it is to a specific review in the context of all reviews.
        *   In my project, I used Scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer` with `max_features=2500` (to use the top 2500 words/phrases) and `ngram_range=(1, 2)` (to consider both single words like 'good' and two-word phrases like 'very good' as features)."

7.  **Machine Learning Model (Decision Tree):**
    *   **What you should explain:** Which model did you choose and why? Briefly, how does it work?
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** "I chose a Decision Tree classifier.
        *   **Why:** It's relatively simple to understand, its decisions can be visualized (it's a 'white-box' model), and it's computationally efficient for a mini-project.
        *   **How it works:** It learns a set of 'if-then-else' rules based on the TF-IDF features to classify a review as positive or negative. It splits the data at each step based on the feature that best separates the sentiments.
        *   I used `class_weight='balanced'` in Scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` to help the model perform better if there was an imbalance between the number of positive and negative reviews in my training data."

8.  **Sentiment-Rating Alignment Logic:**
    *   **What you should explain:** How does your system decide if the text sentiment and star rating are "Aligned" or "Not Aligned"?
    *   **Your SRAS Context (from `api.py`):** "The alignment logic is:
        *   It's 'Aligned' if the predicted text sentiment is 'Positive' AND the star rating is 4 or 5.
        *   OR if the predicted text sentiment is 'Negative' AND the star rating is 1 or 2.
        *   In all other cases (like positive text with a 3-star rating, or negative text with a 5-star rating), it's considered 'Not Aligned'."

**III. System Architecture & Implementation**

9.  **Overall System Architecture (Frontend, Backend, ML Model):**
    *   **What you should explain:** Describe the main parts of your SRAS system and how they interact. A simple block diagram explanation would be great.
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** "My system has three main parts:
        1.  **Frontend:** A React web page (`App.jsx`) where the user types in a review and rating. It sends this data to the backend and shows the results.
        2.  **Backend:** A Python API built with FastAPI (`api.py`). This API receives the data from the frontend, uses the pre-trained machine learning model (`model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`) to analyze the sentiment and check alignment, and then sends the result back.
        3.  **Training Pipeline (Offline):** Python scripts (`Training_py.py`) that I used to preprocess the `Training_Data.csv`, train the Decision Tree model, and save the model and TF-IDF vectorizer as `.pkl` files."
    *   **Data Flow:** Be ready to trace what happens when a user clicks "Analyze". (User input -> React -> Axios POST request -> FastAPI backend -> Preprocessing -> TF-IDF transform -> Model predict -> Alignment logic -> JSON response -> React displays result).

10. **Backend (FastAPI - `api.py`):**
    *   **What you should explain:** Key functionalities of `api.py`.
    *   **Your SRAS Context:**
        *   "It defines an API endpoint `/analyze` that accepts POST requests."
        *   "It loads the saved `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` when it starts."
        *   "It uses Pydantic (`ReviewRequest`) for validating the input data (review string, rating integer)."
        *   "It preprocesses the incoming review text just like in training."
        *   "It handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) so the React frontend can communicate with it."

11. **Frontend (React - `App.jsx`):**
    *   **What you should explain:** Key functionalities of `App.jsx`.
    *   **Your SRAS Context:**
        *   "It uses React `useState` hooks to manage the review text, rating, results, and any errors."
        *   "It has input fields for the review and rating."
        *   "When the user submits, an `async` function `handleSubmit` uses `axios.post` to send the data to the FastAPI backend (`http://localhost:8000/analyze`)."
        *   "It then displays the sentiment and relevance received from the backend, or an error message."

12. **Model Training (`Training_py.py`):**
    *   **What you should explain:** What does this script do?
    *   **Your SRAS Context:**
        *   "This script loads the `Training_Data.csv`."
        *   "It calls the `preprocess_text` function."
        *   "It initializes and fits the `TfidfVectorizer`."
        *   "It splits the data into training and testing sets (using `train_test_split` with stratification) for evaluation purposes within the script."
        *   "It trains the `DecisionTreeClassifier`."
        *   "It prints performance metrics like accuracy and a classification report."
        *   "Crucially, it saves the trained `model` and the fitted `cv` (TF-IDF vectorizer) as `.pkl` files using `pickle.dump`. These are the files used by the backend."
    *   **`update_model.py`:** "I also have a utility script `update_model.py` that copies these newly trained `.pkl` files from the `training` folder to the `backend` folder."

**IV. Results & Evaluation**

13. **Performance Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score):**
    *   **What you should explain:** What do these metrics mean in the context of your project? How did your model perform based on the values you got (from the confusion matrix image)?
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** (Refer to the values: TN=659, FP=12, FN=145, TP=5867)
        *   "**Accuracy** ([calculated as ~97.6%]) tells me the overall percentage of reviews my model classified correctly."
        *   "**Precision for Positive class** ([calculated as ~99.8% or 1.00]) means that when my model says a review is positive, it's almost always correct."
        *   "**Recall for Positive class** ([calculated as ~97.6%]) means my model finds most of the actual positive reviews."
        *   "**Precision for Negative class** ([calculated as ~82%]) means when my model says a review is negative, it's correct about 82% of the time."
        *   "**Recall for Negative class** ([calculated as ~98%]) means my model is very good at finding most of the actual negative reviews."
        *   "**F1-Score** balances precision and recall. The F1 for positive is very high ([~0.99]), and for negative is also good ([~0.89])."
        *   **Discuss the imbalance:** "The model performs exceptionally well on the positive class, which is likely the majority class. For the negative (minority) class, recall is high, but precision is a bit lower, meaning it might sometimes incorrectly flag a positive review as negative, but it rarely misses an actual negative one."

14. **Interpretation of the Confusion Matrix:**
    *   **What you should explain:** Explain what TP, TN, FP, FN mean using your specific values.
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** "My confusion matrix shows:
        *   TN = 659: 659 actual negative reviews were correctly classified as negative.
        *   FP = 12: 12 actual negative reviews were *incorrectly* classified as positive.
        *   FN = 145: 145 actual positive reviews were *incorrectly* classified as negative.
        *   TP = 5867: 5867 actual positive reviews were correctly classified as positive."
        "The 145 False Negatives are where the model missed positive sentiment, and the 12 False Positives are where it incorrectly identified negative reviews as positive."

**V. Conclusion & Future Work**

15. **Limitations of Your Project:**
    *   **What you should explain:** Be honest about what your system doesn't do well or what could be improved.
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** (From your report's Chapter 5.8/6)
        *   "It's binary (Positive/Negative), doesn't handle neutral."
        *   "It probably won't understand sarcasm well."
        *   "Performance depends on the training data; it might not generalize perfectly to very different review types."
        *   "It doesn't do aspect-based sentiment (e.g., good camera, bad battery)."
        *   "The alignment logic is rule-based and could be more sophisticated."

16. **Future Enhancements:**
    *   **What you should explain:** If you had more time, what would you add or improve?
    *   **Your SRAS Context:** (From your report's Chapter 6.3)
        *   "I could try more advanced models like LSTMs or BERT."
        *   "Add aspect-based sentiment analysis."
        *   "Try to handle neutral sentiment and sarcasm."
        *   "Use a larger, more diverse dataset."

**General Viva Tips:**

*   **Know Your Code:** Be able to explain any part of your Python (`api.py`, `Training_py.py`) or JSX (`App.jsx`) code if asked.
*   **Be Confident:** You built this! Speak clearly and confidently about your work.
*   **Listen Carefully:** Understand the question before answering.
*   **Be Honest:** If you don't know something, it's better to admit it than to guess incorrectly. You can say, "That's an interesting point I didn't consider, but based on X, I would think Y..."
*   **Simple Explanations:** Avoid overly technical jargon unless the examiner uses it first or you are specifically asked for deep technical details.
*   **Prepare a Short Demo (if possible/allowed):** Showing your system work (user types review, gets result) can be very effective.
*   **Practice:** Go through these points and practice explaining them out loud.

You've done a good job putting this project together. Focus on understanding these key areas, and you should do well in your viva! Good luck!
